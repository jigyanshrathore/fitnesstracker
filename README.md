The provided code creates a dynamic and user-friendly fitness tracking webpage that enables users to monitor their progress across multiple exercises. This application is structured with HTML for layout, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for functionality, resulting in a comprehensive tool for fitness enthusiasts.
HTML Structure
The HTML (index.html) establishes the foundation of the web page. It features a main heading ("Fitness Progress Keeper") and distinct sections for three exercises: Push-ups, Squats, and Sit-ups. Each exercise section includes:

A counter to display the current count.
An "Increment" button to increase the count.
A "Save" button to log the count.
A paragraph to show saved counts.
Additionally, there are buttons to show the total challenges completed and to reset all data, providing users with an overview and the ability to start fresh.
JavaScript Functionality
The JavaScript (app.js) drives the interactive elements of the application. It uses two objects, counts and totals, to keep track of current and cumulative counts for each exercise.

Increment Function: The increment function updates the count for the selected exercise and displays it.
Save Function: The save function logs the current count, adds it to the cumulative total, and resets the current count, updating the display accordingly.
Show Total Function: The showTotal function aggregates and displays the total counts for all exercises, providing a comprehensive summary of the user's progress.
Reset Function: The letStartFromScratch function resets all counts and clears the displayed data, allowing users to start tracking from scratch.
CSS Styling
The CSS (style.css) ensures the webpage is visually appealing and easy to use. The background features an image, and all elements are centered and styled with a modern, clean aesthetic. Flexbox is utilized to align the exercise sections side by side, creating an organized layout. Buttons are distinctively styled with specific colors and consistent padding, making them easily recognizable and interactive. The design uses transparent backgrounds and rounded corners to enhance the overall look and feel.

User Interaction
Users can effortlessly track their fitness activities by incrementing counts, saving their progress, viewing total completed challenges, and resetting the data. This intuitive and engaging interface makes the process of tracking fitness activities straightforward and motivating, helping users stay on top of their fitness goals.

This webpage effectively combines functionality with a pleasing design, making it a valuable tool for anyone looking to track their fitness progress.
